### Roadmap to Improve Coding Skills:

1. **Introduction to Programming Concepts:**

   -  **Variables and Data Types:**

      -  Create a program that calculates the volume of a sphere given its radius.
      -  Write a program to calculate the area of a rectangle given its length and width.

   -  **Control Structures (if statements, loops):**
      -  Implement a program that checks if a number is even or odd using an if statement.
      -  Implement a program that checks if a given number is a palindrome.
      -  Write a program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.
      -  Implement a program that checks if a given number is positive, negative, or zero.
      -  Write a program that determines whether a given year is a leap year using if-else statements.

2. **Data Structures:**

   -  **Arrays:**

      -  Write a function to find the second smallest element in an array.
      -  Implement a program to remove duplicates from a list.
      -  Write a program to find the sum of all elements in an array.

   -  **Lists (or Linked Lists):**
      -  Implement a function to find the median of an unsorted array.
      -  Write a program to rotate a list by a specified number of elements.
      -  Implement a function to reverse a linked list.

3. **Algorithms:**

   -  **Sorting Algorithms:**

      -  Implement Merge Sort to sort an array of integers.
      -  Implement Bubble Sort to sort an array of integers.
      -  Write a program to implement Selection Sort on a list of integers.

   -  **Searching Algorithms:**
      -  Implement a function to perform a binary search on a sorted array.
      -  Write a program to implement Linear Search on a list of integers.

4. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**

   -  **Classes and Objects:**

      -  Create a class representing a Book with attributes like title, author, and publication year.
      -  Create a class representing a Car with attributes like make, model, and year.
      -  Implement a class representing a Student with methods to calculate GPA and display student information.

   -  **Inheritance and Polymorphism:**
      -  Extend the Book class to create subclasses representing different genres of books (e.g., Fiction, Non-Fiction).
      -  Extend the Car class to create a subclass representing a ElectricCar.
      -  Create a subclass of the Student class to represent an Undergraduate student with additional attributes and methods.

5. **Problem-Solving:**

   -  **Recursion:**
      -  Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.
   -  **Dynamic Programming:**
      -  Solve the "Fibonacci sequence" problem using dynamic programming.

6. **Advanced Topics:**

   1. **Graphs and Graph Algorithms:**

   -  **Graph Representation:**

      -  Implement adjacency list and adjacency matrix representations for graphs.
      -  Write a function to convert a graph from adjacency list to adjacency matrix and vice versa.

   -  **Graph Traversal Algorithms:**
      -  Implement Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse a graph and discuss its applications.
      -  Implement Breadth-First Search (BFS) to traverse a graph and discuss its applications.
      -  Write a program to detect cycles in a directed graph using DFS.
      -  Implement a program to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph using BFS.
